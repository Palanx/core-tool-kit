## Tests

Under the path `\Assets\Tests\` you'll find the `EditorMode` and `PlayMode`, those folders have the test for the
previous listed `Modules`, using the same folder structure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `PlayMode` tests aren't already made because I don't feel like doing it for now, I have no time and something
> that I really hate to do is `PlayMode` tests 🫠 BUT! some day I'll include them.

## Documentation

There isn't documentation, each module is self explained and easy to use for a developer with C# experience.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can get involved:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

It is very likely that it does not merge third-party PRs, because I always filter that all code written follows the
same line as the package, and it is very common that game developers write bad code, but come up with very good ideas,
so I almost always take that idea and refactor it.
